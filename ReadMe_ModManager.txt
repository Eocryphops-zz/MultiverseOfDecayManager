Unpack into your SoD game directory, probably at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\State of Decay YOSE\Game\

Then simply double-click to run the .jar, like you would any executable. If you're worried about the contents, then no worries - they're open source :)

No creepy crawlies in there, mate.

For modders, you'll add a new .xml file that you can copy from the CopyMe .xml, and just fill in your own metadata. Once you're filled up to match the existing, then you just run the .jar whenever you make changes and that will delete all of your old objects and add the new versions from the .xml in XmlMods.

Essentially leaving you to work in that file, and run, rather than have to make them directly in that enormous file. Oh my.
